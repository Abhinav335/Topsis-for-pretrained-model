# Text Generation Models Evaluation

This document presents the evaluation results of four text generation models based on different parameters.

## Model Parameters and TOPSIS Evaluation

| Model | Performance Metric 1 | Performance Metric 2 | Performance Metric 3 | TOPSIS Score | Rank |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|------|
| A     | 19.9                 | 0.33                 | 0.14                 | 0.0790       | 4    |
| B     | 44.9                 | 0.34                 | 0.09                 | 0.0700       | 3    |
| C     | 4.22                 | 0.34                 | 0.82                 | 0.0846       | 1    |
| D     | 4.49                 | 0.34                 | 1.97                 | 0.0853       | 2    |

## TOPSIS Evaluation

The TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was used to evaluate the models based on the given parameters. The models are ranked based on their TOPSIS scores, with lower scores indicating better performance.
